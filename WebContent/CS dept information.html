<h4><p><br/><br/>
Welcome to the Computer Science Department at George Mason University! With 50 faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the Volgenau School of Engineering, one of the largest departments on campus, and one of the largest CS departments in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
</p>

<p>Today, not only are computing devices pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost every field of endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and engineering. Given the importance of computing in today's world, we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", i.e., to providing a diverse array of programs and courses in computing to students from all backgrounds and of all levels.</p>

<p>The department has a world-class faculty with research strengths in almost all areas of computing, and a strong commitment to teaching. Our faculty are engaged in leading edge research in their respective fields and have authored widely used textbooks and software. Our faculty's excellence is reflected in the list of awards received for research (12 CAREER/Young Investigator awards, 7 Mason Emerging Researcher awards) and teaching (6 Mason Excellence in Teaching awards).</p> 

<p>Several members of the department's faculty are actively engaged in inter-disciplinary research collaborations with colleagues from all over campus and other universities. Indeed inter-disciplinary collaboration in research and education is a key component of our departmental vision and strategic direction for the future.
</p>

<p>The department has an active Industrial Advisory Board consisting of industry leaders -- many of whom are Mason alumni - who help the department in building strong ties and engaging with alumni, local industry and government agencies, and local K-12 schools. The  members of the Advisory Board also provide the department with critical guidance and feedback so that our courses and programs reflect the state of the art in computing technology, and who help us with our goal of graduating students that are well prepared to meet the workforce needs of the state and the nation. 
</p>

<p>Last but not least, the department is committed to the Mason vision of inclusiveness and accessibilty and to efforts that increase the representation of women and underrepresented minorites in our programs and in  the field of computing, in general.</p></h4>
